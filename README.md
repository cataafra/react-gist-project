## My first React project
### Github Gist Search

This is a basic single-page app that allows you to search for a username on Github, and ,using the Gist API, get the full list of public gists of that user.
It loads a list of gists asynchronously, showing labels for the programming languages used and allowing you to open up the raw files.
